Welcome to ActionWeaver's documentation!
========================================
ActionWeaver's mission is to empower Language Model (LLM) agents by providing the means for orchestrating and scaling external tools effectively.

Check out the :doc:`getting_started/installation` section for how to install the library, :doc:`getting_started/introduction` section for more information, and :doc:`getting_started/concepts` section for a deeper dive into the concepts behind ActionWeaver.

We also have a :doc:`notebooks/use_cases` section with notebooks that demonstrate how to use ActionWeaver for various use cases.
