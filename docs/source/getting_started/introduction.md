# Introduction

ActionWeaver's mission is to empower Language Model (LLM) agents by providing the means for orchestrating and scaling external tools effectively.

ActionWeaver is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It equips developers with the tools to create robust agents that harness the capabilities of [OpenAI's functions](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates).


At a high level, ActionWeaver simplifies the process of creating functions, orchestrating them, and handling the invocation loop. An "action" in this context serves as an abstraction of functions or tools that users want the Language Model (LLM) to handle.

ActionWeaver's vision is to pioneer a new era in program development by seamlessly merging traditional programming techniques with the powerful reasoning capabilities of Language Model Models.
