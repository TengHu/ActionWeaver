# Introduction

ActionWeaver's mission is to empower Language Model (LLM) agents by providing the means for orchestrating and scaling external tools effectively.

ActionWeaver is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It equips developers with the tools to create robust agents that harness the capabilities of [OpenAI's functions](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates).


- Extensibility: Using a straightforward decorator, developers can effortlessly integrate conventional Python code as toolings into their LLM agent, easily enhancing its capabilities.

- Complex Orchestration: Enable orchestration by constructing hierarchies of tools or chaining tools together for intricate and sophisticated applications.


ActionWeaver's vision is to pioneer a new era in program development by seamlessly merging traditional programming techniques with the powerful reasoning capabilities of Language Model Models.
